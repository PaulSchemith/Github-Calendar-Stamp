# GitHub Contribution Calendar Stamper üé®

Design your own GitHub contributions graph by creating fake commits with a simple, intuitive interface. This project uses a Tkinter-based calendar grid to simulate the GitHub contribution heatmap and push commits with backdated timestamps.

## üñºÔ∏è Features

- Visual GitHub-style calendar grid (last 365 days).
- Click and drag to "paint" commits.
- Right-click and drag to erase.
- Tooltip showing commit date.
- Legend showing intensity levels (0 to 4+ commits).
- Push commits to GitHub with correct author and timestamps.
- Commits saved in a `log.txt` file to avoid empty commits.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Git installed and accessible via command line
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
